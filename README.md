#JavaScript Mini-Projects: Rock Paper Scissors & Tic Tac Toe
This repository contains two classic mini-games implemented using JavaScript: Rock Paper Scissors and Tic Tac Toe. These projects are perfect for beginners looking to practice their JavaScript skills or for anyone who enjoys nostalgic games in a digital format.

Rock Paper Scissors
The Rock Paper Scissors game allows players to compete against the computer in the timeless hand game. Players choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The winner is determined based on the classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O'). The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols wins the game. If the grid is filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Both games offer interactive gameplay, allowing players to make selections using buttons or clicks.
Randomized Computer Moves: In Rock Paper Scissors, the computer's move is randomized, providing a dynamic and challenging experience.
Winning Detection: The Tic Tac Toe game detects winning combinations in real-time and displays the winner accordingly.
Responsive Design: The user interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
